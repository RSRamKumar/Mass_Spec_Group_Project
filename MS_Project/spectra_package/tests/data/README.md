# MS Files README

 The **.mzXML** and **.mzML** files are used in this project.
 
 The key features extracted from **mzXML** files are as follows:
  
 
|Features named          |Features called in the file|
| -----------------------|-------------------------- |
| Base Peak              | 'basePeakMz'              |
| Base Peak Intensity    | 'basePeakIntensity'       |
| Highest Observed M/Z   | 'highMz'                  |
|Lowest Observed M/Z     | 'lowMz'                   |
 
 
 The key features extracted from **mzML** files are as follows:
 1.Base Peak 
 2.Base Peak Intensity 
 3.Highest Observed M/Z 
 4.Lowest Observed M/Z
 
|Features named          |Features called in the file|
| -----------------------|-------------------------- |
| Base Peak              | "base peak m/z"           |
| Base Peak Intensity    | "base peak intensity"     |
| Highest Observed M/Z   | "highest observed m/z"    |
|Lowest Observed M/Z     | "lowest observed m/z"     |
